# LeetCode
ðŸ§  LeetCode: Where I battle my own brain cells daily. Featuring elegant solutions, brute force regrets, and the occasional 'why did this even work?' moments.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders based on problem difficulty:

* **Easy:** Solutions to LeetCode easy problems.
* **Medium:** Solutions to LeetCode medium problems.
* **Hard:** Solutions to LeetCode hard problems.

Within each difficulty folder, each problem has its own dedicated folder, named with the problem's LeetCode number and title. Inside each problem folder is the actual solution file, also named with the problem's number and title.

Example path: `easy/20. Valid Parentheses/20. Valid Parentheses.py`

## Language

Currently, all solutions are written in Python3. Future updates may include solutions in other languages such as C, C++, etc.

## Naming Convention

Each solution file is named using the exact title of the corresponding LeetCode problem. This makes it easy to find solutions for specific problems.

## Self-Contained and Runnable

Each solution file is designed to be self-contained and runnable. You can execute them directly from the command line using a Python interpreter.

## Test Cases and Main Functions

Many solutions include test cases and a `main()` function to demonstrate their functionality. This allows you to easily verify the correctness of the solutions.

## Time and Space Complexity

Each solution file includes comments at the beginning that discuss the time and space complexity of the algorithm. This allows for quick understanding of the solution's performance characteristics.

Example:

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

# ... Solution code ...
```

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/LeetCode.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/LeetCode.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the directory containing the solution you want to run:

    ```bash
    cd LeetCode/Easy  # Or Medium/Hard
    ```

3.  Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python3 "Problem Title.py"
    ```

    Replace `"Problem Title.py"` with the actual filename.
