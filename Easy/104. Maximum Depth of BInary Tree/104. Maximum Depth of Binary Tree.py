'''
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Time Complexity: O(n)   - Where we iterate over all nodes in the tree once 
Space Complexity: O(h)  - Where the maximum space of the recursive call stack is defined by the height of the tree
