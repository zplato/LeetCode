Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

Constraints:
    0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

        #             Loop over numbers until we find that the square of num is greater

Time Complexity:  O(log x)  - Utilizing peform binary search over the range [0, x], where we cut the search space in half on each interation 
Space Complexity: O(1):     - Utilizing fixed number of variables (low, mid and high), so constant space is used
