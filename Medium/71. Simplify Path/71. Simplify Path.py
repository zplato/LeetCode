# You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.
#
# The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:
#
# A single period '.' represents the current directory.
# A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
# Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
# Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
# The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:
#
# The path must start with a single slash '/'.
# Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
# The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
# The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
# Return the simplified canonical path.

# Approach:

1. Split the given absolute path by '/' to handle directory names and filter out empty strings or current directory references ('.').
2. Use a stack (list) to process each directory:
   - If the directory is '..', pop from the stack if itâ€™s not empty.
   - If the directory is valid (not '.' or empty), push it onto the stack.
3. Join the stack with '/' and prepend a root '/' to return the simplified canonical path.

# Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over each part of the split path once.

# Space Complexity:
O(n), in the worst case, all parts are valid directories and are stored in the stack.
