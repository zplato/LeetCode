'''
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Constraints:
    0 <= nums.length <= 105
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Time Complexity - O(n) - Given we create a set which is a O(n) operation and iterating over that set is a < O(n) operation 
Space Complexity - O(n) - worst case is that all of the input nums are unique.
